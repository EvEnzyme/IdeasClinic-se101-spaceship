This project is built as a replacement for the current system built in godot with C#, as students were having many errors downloading and running the program. 
JavaScript is built to run on any deviceâ€™s browser and the editing process for students will be very straightforward. TypeScript was added for better documentation, but students can choose to write javascript or Typescript code, the compile to integrate.
